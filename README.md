VandyHacks IX Entry - Bankopedia is a one-stop-shop to everything a person would need to manage and improve their financial situation. With helpful feedback about current and past trends in account details including spending and saving, people can make better and more informed decisions about how to use their money. Bankopedia has places to learn more information about critical personal finance tools and read news related to market trends. It can track achievements in a gamified way to encourage better habits, and even connects with your friends to promote healthy competition like many apps already do with fitness. Bankopedia helps set up notifications for paying important bills on time, so you are never left surprised the day after taxes were due or your mortgage payment was supposed to be collected.
